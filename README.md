# Time Series Library (TSLib)
TSLib is an open-source library for deep learning researchers, especially for deep time series analysis.

We provide a neat code base to evaluate advanced deep time series models or develop your model, which covers five mainstream tasks: **long- and short-term forecasting, imputation, anomaly detection, and classification.**

:triangular_flag_on_post:**News** (2025.11) Considering the rapid development of Large Time Series Models (LTSMs), we have newly added a [[zero-shot forecasting]](https://github.com/thuml/Time-Series-Library/blob/main/exp/exp_zero_shot_forecasting.py) feature in TSLib. You can try [this script](https://github.com/thuml/Time-Series-Library/blob/main/scripts/long_term_forecast/ETT_script/LTSM.sh) to evaluate LTSMs.

:triangular_flag_on_post:**News** (2025.10) Given the recent confusion among researchers regarding minor improvements on standard benchmarks, we propose the [[Accuracy Law]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02729) to characterize the objectives of deep time series forecasting tasks, which can be used to identify saturated datasets.

:triangular_flag_on_post:**News** (2024.10) We have included [[TimeXer]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19072), which defined a practical forecasting paradigm: Forecasting with Exogenous Variables. Considering both practicability and computation efficiency, we believe the new forecasting paradigm defined in TimeXer can be the "right" task for future research.

:triangular_flag_on_post:**News** (2024.10) Our lab has open-sourced [[OpenLTM]](https://github.com/thuml/OpenLTM), which provides a distinct pretrain-finetuning paradigm compared to TSLib. If you are interested in Large Time Series Models, you may find this repository helpful.

:triangular_flag_on_post:**News** (2024.07) We wrote a comprehensive survey of [[Deep Time Series Models]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13278) with a rigorous benchmark based on TSLib. In this paper, we summarized the design principles of current time series models supported by insightful experiments, hoping to be helpful to future research.

:triangular_flag_on_post:**News** (2024.04) Many thanks for the great work from [frecklebars](https://github.com/thuml/Time-Series-Library/pull/378). The famous sequential model [Mamba](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00752) has been included in our library. See [this file](https://github.com/thuml/Time-Series-Library/blob/main/models/Mamba.py), where you need to install `mamba_ssm` with pip at first.

:triangular_flag_on_post:**News** (2024.03) Given the inconsistent look-back length of various papers, we split the long-term forecasting in the leaderboard into two categories: Look-Back-96 and Look-Back-Searching. We recommend researchers read [TimeMixer](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=7oLshfEIC2), which includes both look-back length settings in experiments for scientific rigor.

:triangular_flag_on_post:**News** (2023.10) We add an implementation to [iTransformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06625), which is the state-of-the-art model for long-term forecasting. The official code and complete scripts of iTransformer can be found [here](https://github.com/thuml/iTransformer).

:triangular_flag_on_post:**News** (2023.09) We added a detailed [tutorial](https://github.com/thuml/Time-Series-Library/blob/main/tutorial/TimesNet_tutorial.ipynb) for [TimesNet](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=ju_Uqw384Oq) and this library, which is quite friendly to beginners of deep time series analysis.

:triangular_flag_on_post:**News** (2023.02) We release the TSlib as a comprehensive benchmark and code base for time series models, which is extended from our previous GitHub repository [Autoformer](https://github.com/thuml/Autoformer).

## Usage

1. Install Python 3.8. For convenience, execute the following command.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Prepare Data. You can obtain the well-preprocessed datasets from [[Google Drive]](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13Cg1KYOlzM5C7K8gK8NfC-F3EYxkM3D2?usp=sharing), [[Baidu Drive]](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1r3KhGd0Q9PJIUZdfEYoymg?pwd=i9iy) or [[Hugging Face]](https://huggingface.co/datasets/thuml/Time-Series-Library). Then place the downloaded data in the folder`./dataset`. Here is a summary of supported datasets.

<p align="center">
<img src=".\pic\dataset.png" height = "200" alt="" align=center />
</p>

3. Train and evaluate the model. We provide the experiment scripts for all benchmarks under the folder `./scripts/`. You can reproduce the experiment results as the following examples:

```
# long-term forecast
bash ./scripts/long_term_forecast/ETT_script/TimesNet_ETTh1.sh
# short-term forecast
bash ./scripts/short_term_forecast/TimesNet_M4.sh
# imputation
bash ./scripts/imputation/ETT_script/TimesNet_ETTh1.sh
# anomaly detection
bash ./scripts/anomaly_detection/PSM/TimesNet.sh
# classification
bash ./scripts/classification/TimesNet.sh
```

4. Develop your own model.

- Add the model file to the folder `./models`. You can follow the `./models/Transformer.py`.
- Include the newly added model in the `Exp_Basic.model_dict` of  `./exp/exp_basic.py`.
- Create the corresponding scripts under the folder `./scripts`.

Note: 

(1) About classification: Since we include all five tasks in a unified code base, the accuracy of each subtask may fluctuate but the average performance can be reproduced (even a bit better). We have provided the reproduced checkpoints [here](https://github.com/thuml/Time-Series-Library/issues/494).

(2) About anomaly detection: Some discussion about the adjustment strategy in anomaly detection can be found [here](https://github.com/thuml/Anomaly-Transformer/issues/14). The key point is that the adjustment strategy corresponds to an event-level metric.
