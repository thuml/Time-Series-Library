# Time Series Library (TSlib)
TSlib is an open-source library for deep learning researchers, especially for deep time series analysis.

We provide a neat code base to evaluate advanced deep time series models or develop your own model, which covers five mainstream tasks: **long- and short-term forecasting, imputation, anomaly detection, and classification.**

:triangular_flag_on_post:**News** (2023.10) We add an official implementation to [iTransformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06625), which is the state-of-the-art model for long-term forecasting.

:triangular_flag_on_post:**News** (2023.09) We added a detailed [tutorial](https://github.com/thuml/Time-Series-Library/blob/main/tutorial/TimesNet_tutorial.ipynb) for [TimesNet](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=ju_Uqw384Oq) and this library, which is quite friendly to beginners of deep time series analysis.

## Leaderboard for Time Series Analysis

bash ./scripts/anomaly_detection/PSM/TimesNet.sh
# classification
bash ./scripts/classification/TimesNet.sh
```

4. Develop your own model.

- Add the model file to the folder `./models`. You can follow the `./models/Transformer.py`.
- Include the newly added model in the `Exp_Basic.model_dict` of  `./exp/exp_basic.py`.
- Create the corresponding scripts under the folder `./scripts`.
