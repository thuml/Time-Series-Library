# Time Series Library (TSlib)
TSlib is an open-source library for deep learning researchers, especially for deep time series analysis.

We provide a neat code base to evaluate advanced deep time series models or develop your model, which covers five mainstream tasks: **long- and short-term forecasting, imputation, anomaly detection, and classification.**

:triangular_flag_on_post:**News** (2023.10) We add an implementation to [iTransformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06625), which is the state-of-the-art model for long-term forecasting. The official code and complete scripts of iTransformer can be found [here](https://github.com/thuml/iTransformer).

:triangular_flag_on_post:**News** (2023.09) We added a detailed [tutorial](https://github.com/thuml/Time-Series-Library/blob/main/tutorial/TimesNet_tutorial.ipynb) for [TimesNet](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=ju_Uqw384Oq) and this library, which is quite friendly to beginners of deep time series analysis.

## Usage

1. Install Python 3.8. For convenience, execute the following command.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Prepare Data. You can obtain the well pre-processed datasets from [[Google Drive]](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13Cg1KYOlzM5C7K8gK8NfC-F3EYxkM3D2?usp=sharing) or [[Baidu Drive]](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1r3KhGd0Q9PJIUZdfEYoymg?pwd=i9iy), Then place the downloaded data in the folder`./dataset`. Here is a summary of supported datasets.

</p>

3. Train and evaluate model. We provide the experiment scripts for all benchmarks under the folder `./scripts/`. You can reproduce the experiment results as the following examples:

```
# long-term forecast
bash ./scripts/long_term_forecast/ETT_script/TimesNet_ETTh1.sh
# short-term forecast
bash ./scripts/short_term_forecast/TimesNet_M4.sh
# imputation
bash ./scripts/imputation/ETT_script/TimesNet_ETTh1.sh
# anomaly detection
bash ./scripts/anomaly_detection/PSM/TimesNet.sh
# classification
bash ./scripts/classification/TimesNet.sh
```

4. Develop your own model.

- Add the model file to the folder `./models`. You can follow the `./models/Transformer.py`.
- Include the newly added model in the `Exp_Basic.model_dict` of  `./exp/exp_basic.py`.
- Create the corresponding scripts under the folder `./scripts`.
